# Project licence boundary (WP00.02)

All four current ArcSlate projects, including tests and repository tooling, declare
`PackageLicenseExpression=AGPL-3.0-only` and `LicenceBoundary=AGPL`. The closed
inventory is `eng/policy/licence-boundary.json`, following the accepted
[Design profile](https://github.com/ArcForges/ArcForges-Design/blob/6ba885ad38dd71de532c74d7b69f439d01d19a0a/docs/architecture/01-solution-and-project-layout.md#41-project-declaration-and-verification-profile).

The existing C# repository `check` command compares the actual Git inventory with
that data, reads every declaration and imported property file, checks project
reference containment and validates the locked first-party package identities.
An added project, missing declaration, inconsistent pair, escaped reference or
unknown first-party package fails the check. Dependency licences remain separate
from the owner's SPDX declaration; the existing distribution notices are retained.

`Directory.Build.targets` also checks effective MSBuild properties before build
and pack, so an imported or command-line override cannot bypass source checks.
The inventory test runs in every native CI job. It writes the source commit,
dirty state, evaluated MSBuild declarations, reference edges and complete project list to
`artifacts/evidence/licence-boundary.json`, retained with the existing UI evidence.
Adversarial C# tests exercise declaration, inventory, import, reference and lock
failures. The existing locked restore, format, build, tests, five-RID Native AOT
UI/live-Cloud checks and immutable candidate verification remain required.

This change preserves published dependency versions, application identity,
signing behavior and product scope. A policy pass does not prove product readiness
or close a later commercial-release gate. Current runs and post-merge assets must
be verified for their exact source commit.
